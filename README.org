#+TITLE: Readme

This is my dotfiles, managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU =stow=]].
Some basic prerequisite in an Ubuntu-based distro:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep git stow
#+end_src

Then the dotfiles can be setup all at once with:

#+begin_src bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/hieutkt/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow --target=$HOME --restow */
#+end_src
