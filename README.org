#+TITLE: Readme

This is my dotfiles, managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU =stow=]].
Basic prerequisite in an Ubuntu-based distro are as follow:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep git stow
#+end_src

Then the dotfiles can be set up all at once with:

#+begin_src bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/hieutkt/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
stow --target=$HOME --restow */
#+end_src

Or set up individual modules only. For example:

#+begin_src bash
stow --target=$HOME -restow shell # For zsh or bash setup
#+end_src
